# GriefPreventionFlags

I created this Minecraft server plugin using the Bukkit API to empower server admins to create unique experiences for players based on location in the world.  It's similar to WorldGuard, but it's more performant, easier to use, and includes many more useful flags than WorldGuard does.  It also doesn't require WorldEdit to run (unlike WorldGuard).  Admins can also empower players to self-serve by giving them access to specific flags, which they can then only use on land claims they own.

On my own servers, I used it to create PvP arenas, parkour challenges, a prison, a spleef arena, a snowball fight arena, fast travel teleporters, and a new player spawn where players never die or get stuck, and can't injure the animals or NPCs.

I stopped working on this project after Minecraft 1.10.  Anyone may use my source code to continue the project, but see the LICENSE file for restrictions.
